# London-TextFolio

* Fork of "London" theme for more text-heavy portfolios
* Preferred UX / navigation is project-based â€” feels very overwhelming when i add 2ndary navigation + all the project pages
* Doesn't use "wide" image widths for galleries (commented out only)
* Doesn't use mobile hamburger or 2ndary navigation
* Uses TOCBOT
* Slightly narrower margins for less scrolling through sections of text
