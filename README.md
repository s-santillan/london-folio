# London-TextFolio (london-folio)

* Fork of "London" theme for more text-heavy portfolios
* Preferred UX / navigation is project-based â€” feels very overwhelming when i add 2ndary navigation + all the project pages
* Doesn't use "wide" image widths for galleries (commented out only)
* Doesn't use mobile hamburger or 2ndary navigation
* Uses TOCBOT
* Slightly narrower margins for less scrolling through sections of text
* The original theme prefers using vw for element margins/paddings as a quick way to scale up/down based on viewport (mobile/desktop) w/o having to use breakpoints. However this breaks on extra-large, high-resolution screens. I'll be removing the use of vw slowly.
